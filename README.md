My data-driven research initiative focuses on the Berkeley Fire Department’s purchasing activity for Fiscal Year 2024-2025, using real procurement data I personally managed during my time in the department’s Accounting Division. This analysis identifies all active vendors the department engaged with during the year and reveals key spending patterns, vendor relationships, and category-level trends.

The goal is to deliver actionable insights that support smarter budget planning and more strategic decision-making in future fiscal years. By making this information transparent and easy to understand, I aim to help department heads and division managers gain a clearer view of how public safety funds are allocated and spent. Explore the data, discover the trends, and join me in building a more informed approach to municipal budgeting.


The Berkeley Fire Department serves the City of Berkeley, California, providing fire prevention, emergency medical services, and disaster response. The department operates multiple fire stations and responds to thousands of emergency calls each year.

Berkeley is a dynamic city that, despite having only ten square miles of land and seven square miles of water, commands a global presence. Celebrated for its legacy of academic excellence, research, cultural vibrancy, and free expression, it is home to a world-renowned university, more than 50 public parks, and the largest public marina in the San Francisco Bay Area.
